# Sales-Data-Analysis
Created a report for company using Power BI. Based on the insights from the report, the management can make informed decisions. For example, identifying the five best-selling products allows the company to promote these products further by offering discounts, thereby potentially increasing sales. Such data-driven decisions are critical for business growth.
Used Power BI tool to create dashboad and data was imported from excel shared by the company.
